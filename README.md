# server-side-rendering

A small experiment to show how we can handle Server Side Rendering in different JS frameworks and libraries.

It consists of a small page that displays a list of music albums retrieved from a server.

The concerned technologies are: 

1. React: https://github.com/morris-ribs/server-side-rendering/tree/master/react
2. Inferno: https://github.com/morris-ribs/server-side-rendering/tree/master/inferno
3. Angular (TBD)
